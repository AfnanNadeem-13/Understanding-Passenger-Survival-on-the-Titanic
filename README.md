  ## **Understanding Passenger Survival on the Titanic**
  

🚢 Insights into Passenger Demographics and Survival Probabilities

📌 Overview

This project explores passenger survival on the Titanic using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The goal is to analyze different factors influencing survival rates and gain deeper insights through visualizations.

📂 Dataset Information

Source: Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)

Columns Include:

Survived (Target Variable: 0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Pclass (Passenger Class: 1st, 2nd, 3rd)

Sex (Male/Female)

Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch (Various Passenger Attributes)

🔍 Steps in the Analysis

This project follows a structured EDA process:

1️⃣ Data Loading: Read the dataset using Pandas.2️⃣ Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and check for inconsistencies.3️⃣ Feature Engineering: Create new variables like FamilySize and Title.4️⃣ Visualizations: Generate insights using histograms, bar charts, and heatmaps.5️⃣ Correlation Analysis: Identify relationships between variables and survival.6️⃣ Summary of Findings: Key insights from the analysis.

📊 Visualizations

Here are some key visual insights from the dataset:

Survival Rate by Passenger Class

Correlation Heatmap

Age Distribution of Survivors vs. Non-Survivors

🚀 How to Use

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AfnanNadeem-13/Understanding-Passenger-Survival-on-the-Titanic.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Understanding-Passenger-Survival-on-the-Titanic

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run Jupyter Notebook

📌 Key Findings

✅ Women had a higher survival rate than men.✅ 1st class passengers survived more often than lower classes.✅ Higher fares correlated with better survival chances.✅ Passengers traveling alone had lower survival rates than those with family.
